Issue2:
	Při přidávání stavů do objektu se občas napíše hláška, QGraphicsScene::addItem: item has already been added to this scene.
    Objekt se pak nepřidá. Opakováním klikáním se to povede.

Issue4:
	Lepší chybové hlášky při nevalidních linkách.

Issue5:
	Při mazání označených prvků mi to napsalo hlášku: QGraphicsScene::removeItem: item 0x1c0aac39990's scene (0x0) is different from this scene (0x1c0aa4edeb0)

Issue6:
	Při načtení diagramu z JSON mi to napsalo hlášku: QGraphicsScene::addItem: item has already been added to this scene

Issue7:
	Udělat ještě export do JPG s bílým pozadím.

Issue8:
	Lišta s vlastnostma má reflektovat vlastnosti prvků na které se klikne.

Issue9:
	Měnitelný velikost fontu jako vlastnost objektů

Issue10:
	Vymyslet z pohledu UX lepší způsob vybrání vytvářeného linku.

Issue11:
	Přeuspořádat menu do kartiček a udělat asi ikonky

Issue12:
	Vztah affect ukazuje jen proces->objekt (P2 affects O3.) a ne obráceně, zjistit podle normy, jak to je.

Issue13:
	Vztah specialization má stejně znění jako generalizace. Je správně, jen zjistit, jak je to dle standardu, protože pak je to redundantní vztah.
	Dokonce při nahrání souboru se specialization změnil na generalization (a asi se správným směrem).

Issue14:
	Při importu jsou prvky zacvaknuté v gridu a nevypadá to nejlépe, musí se následně rozmístit. Chtělo by to vhodnější algoritmus. Tohle nechat na později.

Issue15: 
	Chtělo by to, aby když se nahrává nebo generuje OPD z OPL, tak aby to bylo v místě na které kouká uživatel.

Issue16:
	Vytvoři korpus příkladů jak vypadá NLP na OPL.

Pes je objekt, který procesem čůrání čůrá na objekty zlé lidi.
